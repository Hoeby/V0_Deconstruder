#assembly instructions#

[note: advise use of vc3 on all fasteners except M2x20 into plastic (optional) for 

##Heatset inserts:##

extruder body: 2x voron standard in front
nose_plate: 2x M2 x 3.2mm heatset inserts. insert after inserting the M3 x 40 SHCS/BHCS
sheet_redirector: 2 x M2 x 3.2mm heatsets. twice. 
modified_carraige: 2: m3 voron standard in front. ignore latch heatset. 2x M2 x 3.2 heatsets. insert after installing M3 heatsets. 


##laser cut variant##

###Caution!### your parts may not be deburred as recieved from your laser cutting supplier if you opted against that option as advised in the sourcing guide. If this is the case they may have sharp edges.  

Inspect parts for defects. Use a file and deburr any sharp edges on exterior features. 


Your laser cut parts will have a very slight taper to the cut (insert picture laser.profile). Keep this in mind when inserting bearings, as they will be easier to install from one side. Be careful to insert the bearings straight (insert picture bearing.insertion) into the nose plate and stepper plates, then use a vice ,two 695 bearings and an M5 bolt and nut, or other tool to press the bearings in until flush with the face (picture using tool)

Insert 2 M2.5x8 SHCS through back of forward_stepper_plate into the hotend but do not fully tighten(picture)

Stack the rear_stepper_plate, printed_shim, and forward_stepper plate together, then insert the 50t gear/shaft assembly. (pic)

Insert ptfe tube into extruder_body, then stack onto assembly. Insert 2x M2.5 x 14 SHCS into hot end. (pic)
stack assembly on Nema14, insert screws. do not fully tighten. (pic)

Tighten all 4 screws for the hot end at this time.(pic)

Press 3mm shaft onto nose plate using printed_tool found in repo. (pic)
Insert idler bearing and idler gear. grease bearings and apply a very light amount of grease to the meshing gears. Do not use too much or it will get onto the filament and ruin your prints!(pic)
Install nose plate, gently wiggling while aligning all parts. 
install 2x M3 x 8 BHCS. Do not fully tighten. 

while rotating the driven side of the BMG gear with your thumb, gently press down on the Nema14 while squeezing the entire assembly with one hand and tightendown the two screws securing the extruder stepper. Check for backlash between the 8t or 10t gear on the stepper and the 50t gear. adjust if needed. Check for free movement of the extruder gears by moving either the driven side or idler side of the BMG gears. You should be able to spin them with a slight amount of resistance from the stepper. Shift the stacked assembly around and adjust backlash as needed. 
Tighten front two screws. 

Congratulations, your extruder and hot end core assembly is complete. You can move onto installing the net and fans/ducts. 

##fan net##
Inspect bends on fan net and ensure they are square. (pic)
gently bend against a table if needed(pic)

If already installed, remove heater block, along witth heatbreak, tubes, and the 2 small screws, being careful not to lose any parts. Be careful, some parts may be loose fitting and want to fall out as you remove assembly! (pic)

Install fan net using 2 M2.5 x 6 SHCS. Note the orientation of the net. Both net types only go on correctly in one orientation (picture)
If using volcano block, install heater cartridge and thermister prior to reinstalling on heatsink. 
Depending on how you choose to route the wires from the heater block, you may want to cut a small notch in the 2510 fan for routing of the thermister wire.
Route the wires through the holes between the heater block and net, and install screws for heatterblock. **DO NOT OVERTIGHTEN, THEY ARE EASY TO STRIP**
Install the 2510 fan and route the wires

##4010 options##

Secure each 4010 fan to the nose plate, then place the ducts onto each fan. Note the orientation of the ducts as they are mirror images of each other.
Secure both fans and cuts to the fan net using M2x10 SHCS, through the inside of the fan net, into a nut on the other side of the duct. use the tip of your finger to hold the nut while starting the screws, being careful not to crossthread it. 
Insert 2 M3 x 40? BHCS and secure toolhead to carraige. 
(optional) insert M2 x 20 through extruder and tighten. Do not overtighten. If using lighteight 50t(or drill a hole through it), you can install 2nd M2 x 20mm through the hole. 
Insert M2 x 6 or M2 x 8 with fan_saver_2mm into nose plate and tighten. Do not overtighten. 
If using optional x_axis_carraige, insert and tighten M2 x 6 ( or M2 x 8 + fan_saver_2mm) 

##sheet redirection##

Secure both sheet redirectors to the fan net using M2 x 6 or M2 x 8mm SHCS using a ball end allen key.
Insert 2 M3 x 35? BHCS and secure toolhead to carraige. 
(optional) insert M2 x 20 through extruder and tighten. Do not overtighten. If using lighteight 50t(or drill a hole through it), you can install 2nd M2 x 20mm through the hole.  

Congratulations. Your toolhead is now assembled.
